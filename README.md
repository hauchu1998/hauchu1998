#### A bit more of me
I have been in the web3 space for one and a half years, and it's been a lot of fun since I started building. I've worked on a few NFT and DAO projects, and last summer, I had this amazing experience to intern at [Solana Labs](https://solana.com). While there, I built a [tool](https://app.realms.today/realms) that enables users to manage their DAOs with [compressed NFTs](https://solana.com/news/state-compression-compressed-nfts-solana). After that, I attended a couple of hackathons like EthGlobal in the past three months to explore more cool projects. Other than that, I joined a lab at Cornell Tech where I researched [state-proof generation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xj4NsDnvHgrTBvKHvg1qixD9DQpanNdm/view?usp=sharing) using Merkle trees and zk-SNARK.
